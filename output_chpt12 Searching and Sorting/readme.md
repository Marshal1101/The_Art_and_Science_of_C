# OBJECTIVES
     To be able to implement and use the linear search and binary search algorithms to find data in an array.
     To appreciate the differences in efficiency between these algorithms.
     To understand the implementation of a simple sorting algorithm called selection sort.
     To recognize how the efficiency of the selection sort algorithm depends on the number of data items.
