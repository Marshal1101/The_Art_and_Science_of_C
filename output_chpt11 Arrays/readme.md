# Chapter 11 Arrays
    Little boxes on a hillside, little boxes made of ticky-tacky
    Little boxes, little boxes, little boxes all the same
    There’s a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one
    And they’re all made out of ticky-tacky and they all look just the same
     Malvina Reynolds, "Little Boxes," 1962
