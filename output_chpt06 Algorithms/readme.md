# Chapter 6 Algorithms
    People like definite decisions, tidy answers, all the little ravellings snipped off, the lint removed....

# OBJECTIVES
     To acquire a better sense of the process of algorithm development by investigating several algorithms from classical mathematics.
     To recognize that most problems can be solved using any of several different algorithms.
     To understand the considerations involved in choosing between alternative algorithms.
     To gain a sense of how to establish that an algorithm is correct.
     To understand and be able to apply the concept of a brute-force algorithm.
     To be able to write programs that use the technique of successive approximation.
     To learn how to use the Error function to report error conditions to the user.
     To be able to write programs that perform series expansions.
