    "graphics.h" (for DOS) was not used anymore.


# Chapter Lib7 raries and Interfaces: A simple Graphics Library
    Art, it seems to me, should simplify. That, indeed, is very nearly the whole of the higher artistic process; finding what conventions of from and what details one can do without and yet preserve the spirit of the whole.
     Willa Cather, On the Art of Fiction, 1920
# OBJECTIVES
     To understand the meaning of the terms interface, package, abstraction, implementor, and client as they apply to libraries.
     To recognize that interfaces are represented in C using header files.
     To be able to read the graphics.h interface, which provides access to a library for drawing simple pictures on the screen, and to understand the conceptual abstraction used by the graphics library.
     To learn how to draw lines using Movepen and DrawLine and to draw arcs using DrawArc.
     To learn how to extend the basic capabilities of the graphics library by defining new higher-level functions.
     To practice writing large programs using the graphics package.
     To appreciate the importance of general tools and the associated strategy of bottom-up implementation
