# Chapter 8 Designing Interfaces: A Random Number Library
    And such a wall as I would have you
    Think that had in it a crannied hole, or chink
    Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe
    Did whisper often, very secretly
     Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, 1595-1596
# OBJECTIVES
     To appreciate the principal criteria used to evaluate the design of an interface.
     To discover how paograms can simulate random behavior through the use of pseudo-random
     To understand the behavior of the library function rand.
     To learn how you can use arithmetic operations to change the range of the pseudo-random number sequence.
     To recognize the common types of interface entries.
     To learn the syntactic rules and conventions required to write an interface header file.
     To be able to use the facilities provided by the random.h interface.
